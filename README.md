    I like to program in Python 3.7
    Feel free to look at my math programs, prime numbers, prime number lists, etc.
    I am rather proud of Multiplication table, it makes a multiplication table up to 19 x 19, or how much space you have on your screen up      to 32x32.
    
    Horner 01 solves equations up to the 5:th degree, with iterative processes, called Horners method!
