    I like to program in Python 3.7
    Feel free to look at my math programs, prime numbers, prime number lists, etc.
    I am rather proud of Multiplication table, it makes a multiplication table up to 19 x 19, or how much space you have on your screen up         to 32x32.
    
    I also like my Nice Multiplication table! (For people who do not "like" mathematics) It does not look as "intimidating" as the "normal" multiplication table!
    
    Horner 01 solves equations up to the 5:th degree, with iterative processes, called Horners method!
