    I like to program in Python 3.7
    Feel free to look at my math programs, prime numbers, prime number lists, etc.
    I am also proud of my Twin prime list! It prints out Twin primes, and it is useful to see the distribution of twin primes! 
    (check it out!)
    Multiplication table makes a multiplication table up to 19 x 19, or how much space you have on your screen up to 32x32.
    
    I am fond of my "Nice Multiplication table!" (For people who do not "love" mathematics), is less "intimidating" than the "normal" multiplication table!
    I made use of the fact, that in a "normal multiplication table", the numbers surrounding the square numbers are mirrored! Taking away the "mirrored" image of numbers, makes learning the multiplication table less "daunting!"
    
    Horner 01 solves equations up to the 5:th degree, with an iterative process, called Horners method!
